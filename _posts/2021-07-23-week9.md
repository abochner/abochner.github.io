I continued workinf on assigned portions of the 2FA overleaf paper. We also started working on analyzing the data we have. 

Some data that we found included that When analyzing our survey we found that 75% of our responding participants reported using 2FA for services outside of university context. With the majority (82\%) reporting to use push notifications! 

I also started on my final report due to the DREU, as well as my final presentation in which I will be preseneting at our labs final meeting, along with the other REU's working this summer.
