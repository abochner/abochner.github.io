I can't beleive how fast this summer has gone! Not only have I been working hard alongside an amazing Ph.D. mentor, Professor, and other REU students to complete my research tasks, but we all worked 
togther through a pandemic! Covid-19 has affected my daily life since March of 2020, and this summer has been no exception. Working completly remotly has come with its own unique set of challenges, 
however I have also had covid scares. I have been directly exposed to covid a few times, and with a weak immune system I was very nervous about the outcome. Thankfully, with being full vaccinated, I did
not contract it this summer, but it was something I was worying about it alongside my continued learning experince of academic research. 

I had a great time learning more about two-factor authentication through a liturature review as well as through the surveys that participants had completed. I look forward to continuing to work on this project 
and analyzing more of the data throughout the next school year to then help write an conference paper.
