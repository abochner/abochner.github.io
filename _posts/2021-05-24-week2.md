title: Week 2

My second week included learning more about Professor Camp's lab, attending more lab meetings and one-on-one meetings with Jacob Abbott. I read studies that have already 
been done on two-factor authentication, familiarizing myself with the content in which I will be involved with. I also spend time creating this website. 

I also went through IRB training. In order ot move forward with the project I needed up-to-date IRB training. This needed to be completed prior to me having access to any of the data already being collected for this project, or specifics with the participants. 
Next week we will delve more deeply into the project at large. I am very excited to begin the work!
