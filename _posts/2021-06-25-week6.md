This week I was very productive on the project. I did a small literary review to add to my personal background knowledge of the topic space, as well as be able to 
reference these against our findings. 

We started identifying patterns in the data collected. For example, most students in the survey do not think that one type of login is more secure when utilizing 2FA, two-factor authentication. The data we have collected goes against some of our initial thought about how the data was projected to come out, but that's research! It has been exhilarating to talk through what our initial thoughts of the study were compared to how the data we collected has come out.
