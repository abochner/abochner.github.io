During my first week I attended orientation for the DREU experience where participants were shown their overall milestones to complete this summer as well as a short summary of what research is. There was a verying level of experince for each of the participants, but it was a nice way for us all to "meet" each other during this virtual experience. 
My first week also included a lab meeting with Professor L. Jean Camp, my Ph.D. mentor Jacob Abbott, and other Ph.D. students in Professor Camp's lab. I was able to learn about the expectations for this summer, about my project, and about other project updates happening in the lab. I also had a one on one meeting with Abbott where we went into further discussion about the project.
