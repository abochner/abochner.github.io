OverLeaf for the 2FA study has become something that we have begun utilizing extensively. We had a two-and-a-half-hour meeting this week where we discussed the data that we had with Professor Camp, myself, and the two Ph.D. students on the project. Prior to the actual meeting starting, and the two Ph.D. students and I were able to talk freely, where they both gave me advice about starting graduate school and some tips on how to prepare for it this summer. We have discussed deadlines for the paper, along with how we would like to analyze the data further in order to make it most useful. 

I was also tasked with writing certain sections of the paper, such as methodologies, in order to show my understanding of the project and how to write an academic paper. 

I continued to transcribe interviews as well.
