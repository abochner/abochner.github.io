## About Me

Hello, my name is Ashley Bochner. As of May 2021 I hold a bachelors degree in Informatics with minors in Psychology, Religious Studies, and Human-Centered Computing. Starting Fall 2021 I will begin my Ph.D. journey at the Luddy School of Informatics at Indiana University-Bloomington. As you may know, Ph.D. educational journey's are not as standardized as undergraduate or mastery level, so my estimated finish line is Spring 2027. 

Please reach out with any questions or to connect: ashleybochner16@gmail.com

## About My Project

We're conducting a survey about how people use two-factor authentication at the university and what method they use as second factor. We investigate their perception of the usability of different devices and if any method is more trustworthy or more secure. We will also be conducting interviews to ask people about their 2FA use and whether they use 2FA anywhere besides the university and what form they use. Push notifications, SMS messages, phone calls, physical tokens, etc.
